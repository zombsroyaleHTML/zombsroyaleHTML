## Official Zombsroyale HTML

I would like some help fixing these errors so that this can work all together and this is by far the closest thing to ever get the Zombsroyale html to actually work, id appreciate if anyone knows how to fix some CORS policy errors.

Wish me luck on me getting this to work because im really really close to doing so.

Also if you dont know yet, the original game is https://zombsroyale.io made by End Game Interactive and founder is Yang Liu and Jeremiah (Jerm) Knight, im so sorry if you are mad at me but people really wanted me to do this but I will take this down if they tell me to because I know that what im doing is wrong.

reach out to me if you want this taken down, my email is "ebh8240@gmail.com", if anything is wrong with this then dont tell me because im currently working on a fix for it.
